# PassingBy-EP-Strong-Hackathon-
Scope <br>
	This project involves the creation of a community driven application that will encourage the growth of local businesses, participation in community events, and promote social well-being. The system will keep track of events happening or that will happen in the city of El Paso, it will categorize the events, and provide rewards based on activities completed. Users will be required to make an account in which they will be able to see events either close to their current location or on a city-wide scale in addition to being able to filter the events based on interests. There will be two types of users (player and admin), and a temporary upgrade for the player user. This temporary upgrade to the user is to give them the option to host an event. This upgrade will be given only with permission from the admins and a formal request (name, description, times, location and proof of verification) will be needed. The user functions as a host include managing volunteers (if any), viewing statistics of players participation (usernames of participants are hidden from the host), and receiving point achievements. This upgrade will be active only during the event. Moreover, a regular user will have the ability to explore the city of El Paso and receive points by doing so. These points are used to rank players and give them material benefits such as small discounts at participating businesses around town, or buying aesthetics for use within the app. Events will have tags in order to help users filter them and find events that are relevant to them.Some examples of potential events would be a concert at a local venue, attending El Paso Strong Hackathon, or an open mic night at a coffee shop, and a new exhibit opening at the Museum of Art.  Each activity counts a different value to the score. The app will verify that a user has been to an event/landmark by using their deviceâ€™s location to verify that they are close enough to the event to receive points.If a community/location milestone is reached, the owner might choose to make a special event to reward the community while at the same time promoting their business. The prize milestones would be reset after a given period of time (once a month), in order for the discounts and other similar rewards to not be exploited, the points for locations or events would be given only once a day(or other reasonable amount of time depending on the event/location).The El Pasoans will work together to reach their community milestones and hopefully surpass them. Ultimately, this app aims to increase the sense of community amongst El Pasoans.
